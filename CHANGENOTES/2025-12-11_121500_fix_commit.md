# fix(commit): create changenote before commit for inclusion

## Changes
- `.github/github-copilot-cmd/commit.md` — reordered workflow to create CHANGENOTE before git commit

## Summary
Fixed the /commit workflow to create the CHANGENOTE file before committing, then amend the commit with the actual hash. This ensures the CHANGENOTE is always included in the commit instead of being a separate commit.
